    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Mai was a source of inspiration to us. She was the epitome of love and 
    compassion. Determined to fight adversity, surviving against all challenges 
    and then going on to build a better world, defines our faculty as human beings â€”
    and Mai did all of that. Her life is a story of incredible grit. For us love, courage, 
    dedication and service are the four important life lessons that we have learnt from her. 
    She played an instrumental role in changing the social discourse by backing those who came 
    from challenged backgrounds. Her work will serve as a 
    source of motivation for everyone. Pained by her demise, my sincerest condolences to her family.</p>
